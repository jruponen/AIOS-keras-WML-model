# Using AI OpenScale to check accuracy of Keras Neural Network, classifying images

The purpose of these Notebooks is to demonstrate how to use AI OpenScale for testing accuracy on Keras-based model that is classifying images (in this example, with handwritten digists from MNIST data).  

In order to use AI OpenScale, the trained model is deployed on Watson Machine Learning.  

## Pre-requisities
